# Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction Effects for Load Forecasting


Accurately forecasting electric load lies at the heartof  power  system  operation  routines  such  as  economic  dispatchand optimal power flow. For this reason, the research communityhas  placed  a  lot  of  emphasis  on  developing  accurate  modelsfor  predicting  electric  load  over  recent  years.  Prior  art  in  thisdomain used time-series and linear regression as means of comingup  with  good  forecasting  models.  In  general,  time-series-basedmethods  can  be  quite  accurate  however,  their  non-reliance  ona  well-defined  relationship  between  the  load  and  several  otherquantitative  variables  makes  it  hard  to  interpret,  refine  andimprove them as the underlying factors that affect and drive theelectric  load  change  over  time.  On  the  other  hand,  regression-based  methods  proved  to  be  equally  accurate  with  the  addedadvantage that they can be easily interpreted and thus refined. Inthis work, we use multiple regression with interactions to developa new model that can accurate predict electric load from severalvariables.  We  validate  our  model  and  quantify  its  accuracy  viastandard  statistical  metrics
