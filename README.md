# Multiple Linear Regression with Interaction Effects for Load Forecasting


Accurately forecasting electric load lies at the heart of  power  system  operation  routines  such  as  economic  dispatch and optimal power flow. For this reason, there is a lot of interest  on  developing  accurate  models for  predicting  electric  load  over  recent  years.  Prior  art  in  this domain used time-series and linear regression as means of coming up  with  good  forecasting  models.  In  general,  time-series-based methods  can  be  quite  accurate  however,  their  non-reliance  on a  well-defined  relationship  between  the  load  and  several  other quantitative  variables  makes  it  hard  to  interpret,  refine  and improve them as the underlying factors that affect and drive the electric  load  change  over  time.  On  the  other  hand,  regression-based  methods  proved  to  be  equally  accurate  with  the  added advantage that they can be easily interpreted and thus refined. In this project, we use multiple regression with interaction effects to develop a new model that can accurate predict electric load from several features.  We  validate  different  models  and  quantify  their  performance  via both standard  goodness of fit criteria such as the adjusted R^2 as well as criteria that rely on the test set. $`\sqrt{2}`$
